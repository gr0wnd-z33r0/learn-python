# Lesson 1
## Introduction
Welcome. so you want to learn python? you are in the right place \
First lets look at how the lessons are structured. \
All lessons have a lesson (lesson no).md file \
In theese files are the instructions for that lesson \
Then in the same folder is the python code files. \
## Setting up the environment
1. Downloading an IDE \
To download an IDE first you have to chose. I recomend VScode for beginers but others like pycharm, sublime text and notepad++ are also good choices. \
To download VScode, goto [HERE](code.visualstudio.com) (code.visualstudio.com) then then press "Download for [your OS]" \
Then run through the installer for your IDE and come back.
2. Downloading python \
First go to [HERE](python.org) (python.org) then hover over "DOWNLOADS" it should pop up with "Download for [YOUR OS]" and then the version number below. This tutorial is based on python 3.10 but python almost never changes things too much.\
Then install it \
3. Creating your first program \
Open up your IDE and create a file ending in .py. Ideally call it helloworld.py.
Inside the file write
```python
print("Hello, World")
```
Then in the terminal navigate to the directory, then type python3 hellowworld.py \
